  <p>An old model of an Air China Boeing 747: sharp cuts, straight lines, old colour palette. In the middle of snow storm in Montr√©al. We were at the snow removal station for the accumulated snow in the wings. Heavy compacted snowflakes were falling relentlessly. The massive beast crossed in front of us slowly, silently. Like a moving mountain.The sound of the jet engines was muffled by the airtight windows of the aircraft giving a weird sensation of knowing the sound must be loud due to the closeness of the machine yet not hearing a single thing from it. By now we could only see its tail, right wing and a red blinking light at the end of an antenna. It was no farther than 40 meters from us now yet all you could see now was the tail and a faint red hue. Not even a silhouette was to be seen. As it first appeared it left. Calmly, softly it was eaten by the storm along with 300 Chinese passengers.</p>
<p>While taxing we saw a fox. My first ever wildfox sight. The poor thing was clearly shaken by the loud roar of the airplane engines around him, yet because if the thickness of the storm I doubt he could see anything but white and a couple of landing track guidance lights. It would zigzag and shake off the wet heavy snowflakes that would cover him in a couple of seconds. It looked towards us, not with fear but with some sort of awareness. That whatever the hell that loud flying thing was it wasn&rsquo;t a threat for him or it&rsquo;s prey. But rather a nuisance, an obstacle or landmark he knew he had to be aware of while hunting.</p>
